<p><span>This is an mp3 player I'm making that pulls the appropriate album art from a directory and cuts the image to a circle like a CD and then
rotates it on top of my animation. The head animation is from an old skin of Windows Media Player I used to like when I was a kid. Sad they got rid of these
after Windows XP. Honestly windows XP was the last time I actually liked windows. Anyways it's got a functional volume control I set to incriments of 20%, obviously
controlled with volume up and down on the remote. </p> 
<p><span><br><br>Still a work in progress, my play/pause works but when i play to resume it starts the song over annoyingly. </span></p>
