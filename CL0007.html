<p><span><strong>Bash + Curl</strong></p>
<p><span>I spent some time playing around with curl in the terminal and decided to try making bash scripts for the first time for some of the more useful curls<br>
<br>cornmeal.sh<br><br>
this is just a simple list of my bash scripts I made, I put them all in /usr/local/bin so I can just type their name to launch them and don't have to put ./ infront. Also I can call them from any directory now too which is super cool.</span></p>

<br><p><span>worm.sh<br><br>
this curls a QR encoder for my website and prints the code to the terminal. Pretty nifty stuff. Don't think I'll use it much but its still cool</span></p>

<br><p><span>fb.sh<br><br>
This one curls the weather for my village. Probably the most useful of them all</span></p>
<p><img src="Art/cl/fbBash.png" style="width:100%" /></p>
<br><p><span>I would love to make some more complex/involved bash scripts to learn more but I'm not entirely sure what I would have them even do. <br><br>
Something I'm interested in trying to make is a program that I can use for work for determining affected properties during water shut offs, depending on which water main valves are turned. Ideally I would like to
be able to control it through the terminal as well so maybe interact with it using bash? I don't really know. But it would be cool. Have it print # of affected as well as a list of names/phone #/Addresses</span></p>
