<p><span><strong>Executable Scripts</strong></p>
<p><span>
What I've learned using PyInstaller to bundle my programs. The purpose is to allow people who do not have python installed to be able
to run my programs. <br><br>First test: installed pyinstaller. Open up my terminal session and run the command  
"pyinstaller --noconsole --onefile --icon worm.ico --name worm wormfriend.py" <br> This seemed like it worked, --noconsole [doesnt open a terminal sesh when program is ran]
--onefile [bundles everything up into a single .exe], --icon [sets icon to my file "worm.ico"], --name [name of program] and then "wormfriend.py which is the name of my script.
<br><br>
Testing it on my computer it works fine, but I have python so I sent it to my work PC which doesn't and discovered I got an error that it cannot open worm.ico, no such file exists. So my art files didn't
make it into the bundling process. Trying something new <br><br>
<p><span>
edit code to call the "relative path" for file locations you need to add to the onefile, then include them when building it with pyinstaller like I did below. See if this works. <br>
<br></p></span>
<p>runing the command" pyinstaller --noconsole --onefile --add-data="artfile.gif;." --icon="worm.ico;." worm.py <br>
as well as deleting the old files from the Build and Dist folders created by pyinstaller</p>

<p><span> seems like this does the trick :). Very very cool<br><br>
