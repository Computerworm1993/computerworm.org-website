    <p>This was my first server experiment. I chose fedora 43 server edition since I am used to using fedora workstation as my personal computers daily driver. <br><br>
    As far as operating systems go, it's pretty bare bones. Doesn't ship with a desktop environment, which is nice that it's quite minimal bloat. Just what youd want for a server that would potentially be running near 24/7. <br><br>
I thought it was kind of interesting that I had to install nano text editor myself though, that seems like a basic requirement, but anyways, after installing fedora I installed Apache Http Server.</p>

    <p>It's fairly straight forward to use. By default it listens to port 80, and will serve your .html files from /var/www/html/ directory. This is all customizable through various .conf files as well. And you can serve multiple websites off of different ports too. Pretty neat stuff. <br><br>
    In order to be accessible from the internet I had to go into my routers settings and port forward TCP port 80. Then, since I didn't have a DNS set up, in a web browser I had my friends type in my ip address and it served them up my files perfectly. <br><br>Really cool too about self hosting is being able to see the logs in real time. Whenever someone visited my site I am able to see their ip address as well as their operating system/browser. Interestingly enough I got a hit from India which I assume must have just been some automated webscraper? but it made me a little nervous since I'm certain having a big open door port to the internet is a bit like an invitation for trouble. <br>
<br>
I know there are ways to safely do it but I was just testing stuff out and closed it back up afterwards.</p>

    <p>here you can see my log file that updates in real time. The last ip that I served my files to was the one that when I did a reverse ip lookup it showed India. The rest is my friends iphone [Mac OS X]<br><br>
    Something kind of cool that probably wouldn't be too hard to make is you could send data to a small pi 0 or other micro controller to turn on a light or chime or send you a text whenever you got a web page hit. Nice for a 
small hobbyist site like my own here but it would for sure be annoying if you were more popular lol. Kinda dumb too but in a cool way I guess. I think maybe it'd be more fun to build something like that than it is to have it finished and working if that makes sense</p>
<br><br>
Anyways after I closed down my ports again I did some fiddling with the configs without reading the documentation and now it won't serve files at all; even locally LOL. Which is fine, it takes me nothing to reinstall everything as this was purely experimental for me to learn and play with. I guess thats why they call them Homelabs
