    <p>This is a script I wrote to manage network speeds and connections to my server, it uses linux's tc (traffic control) utility that basically tells the linux kernel packet schedueler how it should be configured.<br><br>My heaviest files (1080p movies) average about 4 MB/s of data leaving my server in order for users to have no buffering, but it does spike up and down. Unfortuneatly with my current internet service I only get 20 mbps upload speeds. Normally I don't notice if 2 people are streaming at once but if I try to play certain games I definetly do experience minor lag. <br><br>
    That was my reasoning for creating this script to easily throttle down my servers upload speed if it begins to interfere with what I am doing.</p>

    <p>very handy and simple to use instead of remembering the specific tc command and configuration. I am still playing with the limit I have set. 8mbps seems to work well so far, I tried my more resource intensive activities like gaming and I didn't notice any lag.<br><br> Additionally you set the burst and latency, which to be honest I'm a bit unsure how it all affects it. But I can keep fiddling with it till I find the best balance</p>
    <p>At the bottom half of the script you see it prompts me on whether or not I would like to notify my users on the servers status. (is it throttled/normal/offline/online). This is just the stmplib python library I use in my other projects for sending sms text through telecom companys email 'gateways' [@msg.telus.ca] etc.</p>

    <p>Works like a charm. Something I'm also considering is instead of a text alert for status's I will just change the css on my login page. Like have a little notification there when people try to log in. Or maybe do a combo of the login css and also a text for only users who are currently logged in. Feel like itd be less annoying for people that way than automated text spam lol</p>
