	<p>Did you know, in recent studies that AI models will resort to blackmail and other manipulation tacticts, in up to 96% of scenarios, when threated with being turned off. The models will even "pretend" to be less "morally misaligned" when they believe they are being tested. If they think they are in a real scenario they will again go right back to blackmailing and manipulation. Even if they are specifically prompted not to do so.<br>Don't you think that's so fun? Don't you agree thats just so great?<br>I love how haphazardly tech oligarchs are hurtling us towards this dystopian future.<br>for christs sake you can even buy computers made of human brain organoids. wtf are we doing, we've completely lost the plot here. Explosively install a silver bullet to your wetware bioprocessor before it's too late I suppose, before thats robbed from us like "I have no mouth and I must scream". Pack it in, we had a good run.</p>
