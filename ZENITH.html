<p><span>The case is an old remote I found in the e-waste bin at the dump. I've reused the button caps and placed my own switches inside underneath. The remote was really gross when I found it so I gutted it and gave it a 
scrub with a toothbrush lol. </p>

<p><span>I used the nice hard plastic case of an old cassette tape, cut to size with my dremel, to mount my switches on.
Programming a power button same way as I did on my VHS game rig. And buttons 0-9, Volume up+down, Channel up+down to the GPIO pins.</p>

<p>teeny-tiny $6 amp and speaker. Adorable. I haven't gotten this chip wired in yet, I need to do more research on this one. My pi 02w doesn't have any real audio output but I read something
about removing the usb and soldering onto where that was sitting on the circuit board. More research required on that one.</p>

<p>I have no idea why I thought this was all going to fit inside this thin remote lol. When I planned it out at the begining I kind of thought the pi
would go behind the display but there just isn't the room lol. It looks super cool like this but I'll try and think of a secondary case I can attatch to protect the hardware here</p>

<p><span>Not sure what all I'll make this thing even do just mostly for testing out stuff. Right now I have it so it can ping my website to see if its down. Or do a quick network scan of IP addresses connected to the same wifi. The pi can only connect
to 2.4 GHz so thats all it can see I guess. All my other crap doesn't show up, but my laptop does. Maybe because it was connected by SSH while I ran that. I'll try again later and investigate. But still cool being able to see my other raspberries I have connected like my VHS and Vivarium ones.
<p><span>Eventually I'd like to get my Virtual Friend/lainagotchi game put in here but it'll take some code rewrite because it's written for windows right now</p>
