	<p>This is another super simple script that I wrote that ended up being quite handy.<br><br>ani-cli is a command line interface webscraping tool for watching anime from your terminal. I like it because it's easy, free and no ads or pop ups which streaming websites are prone to having.</p>
</div>
<div class="round3">one of the arguments when launching ani-cli is --continue, which allows you to pick up from the last episode you left off on. Great. But sometimes I start a show that ends up being too terrible or too cringey to stomach and having it stay in the --continue watching prompt, it gets in the way.<br><br>This script I wrote is similar to my Z shell history editing script, but instead of
searching for a word to delete every line it contains, I just manually delete the lines myself with cntrl+k. Pretty simple but also pretty handy to have</div>

<div class="round3"><p>I included a few arguments in my script as well but it was mostly for practice and experimenting. I only really use -n to open the file in nano text editor</p></div>

<div class="round3">
    <p>the other arguments basically let you make a backup, delete all, delete all of backup, and append to the backup file</p>
