<p><strong>Submiting forms with curl POST command</strong></p>

<div class="round3">
	<p>Potential Use Case: signing in/accepting "terms of service" on public wifi networks without using a browser. </p>
</div>
<br>
<div class="round3">
	<p>Step 1 :<br>
	find the elements on the webpage you need to interact with. Either with curl "https://example.com" and looking through the html<br><br>
OR - (easier)<br>
open webpage in a browser and right click on element (text box, etc. ) -> "inspect"<br>
<br>What we are looking for is the "name" of these input fields. (see image below)

</div>
<div class="round3">
	<p>Now we can start building our curl command. The basic parts we will use are: <br><br>
	-X POST -> tells curl to use POST method <br>
-H "Content-Type: application/json"<br>
-d -> stands for 'data'<br><br>------------------------------------------------<br>
The basics of json will be matching up the "name" we found earlier. i.e. "login", with what we want to enter into that field. i.e my username "Organism"</p>
</div>
<div class="round3">
	<p>
		<a href="https://httpbin.org/post">https://httpbin.org/post</a><br><br>This is a useful example website to make sure your sending the correct data. It simply echos back a JSON response to what you send it. <br>
		<br>
		testing out our command:<br><br>
		curl -X POST https://httpbin.org/post -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"login": "Organism", "password": "CryptOrchid", "accept_terms": true}'<br>
		<br><br><img src="Art/cl/curlPost.png" style="width: 100%;"><br>
	as you can see within the "json" { } brackets, the testing website echos it back correctly.</p>
</div>
<div class="round3">
	<p>Conclusion: <br><br>
		this is my first time posting with curl, ive only ever webscraped with it. <br><br>Curl has many more features to play with, even being able to set --cookie and tell it a text file to write to. and then you can store a token inside that file to post back to the website youre logging into. Will be fun to play around with more<br><br>
	but sadly its approaching midnight and I have a big day at work tomorrow so thats all for now. :)</p>
