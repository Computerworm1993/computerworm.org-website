<p><span>The case is an old remote I found in the e-waste bin at the dump. I've reused the button caps and placed my own switches inside underneath. The remote was really gross when I found it so I gutted it and gave it a 
scrub with a toothbrush lol. </p>

<p><span>I used the nice hard plastic case of an old cassette tape, cut to size with my dremel, to mount my switches on.
Programming a power button same way as I did on my VHS game rig. And buttons 0-9, Volume up+down, Channel up+down to the GPIO pins.</p>

<p>teeny-tiny $6 amp and speaker. Adorable. I haven't gotten this chip wired in yet, I need to do more research on this one. My pi 02w doesn't have any real audio output but I read something
about removing the usb and soldering onto where that was sitting on the circuit board. More research required on that one.</p>

<p>I have no idea why I thought this was all going to fit inside this thin remote lol. When I planned it out at the begining I kind of thought the pi
would go behind the display but there just isn't the room lol. It looks super cool like this but I'll try and think of a secondary case I can attatch to protect the hardware here</p>

<p><span>May 30 Update:: <br>
Managed to port worm.exe [lainagotchi game] in. Was super easy since using the display driver through serial periphery interface to drive the gif animations was done the exact same way I had to do it
using the tkinter library. Just took some real minor tweaks. <br><br> Now I am working on another little UI menu that will act as
the Main Menu. But what is interesting is that it is going to be its own seperent program. <br>This took some fiddling to get going properly but it's super cool. <br>What I've done is at main.py start up it writes it's own "process ID #" into a text file. When you select worm.exe from my new menu, it opens it as a subprocess. Then detatches itself from the main.py script.
Next, at worm.py boot, worm.py opens that same text file, copies main.py's ID #, and then sends the kill command in the terminal. Now main menu is killed and we are left with only worm.py. How awesome is that<br><br>
So what this allows me to do is seemlessly switch back and forth between whatever script I want all by the Zeniths buttons. No keyboard or ssh required. Also lets me keep my various menu items and programs clean and seperated as they each get their very own file<br><br>
During my experiments to get it functioning, before I tried writing the process ID to a file, I tried killing the main.py script within itself but it would execute after opening worm.py. So what this means is that I would have both programs running at the same time, unable to exit themselves lol. They were both fighting for dominance on the display it actually looked
really cool. </p>
