    <p> I started learning rust programming language for fun. There is a lot to it, especially when all I know is bash scripting and python.<br><br>The general consensus online is that it isnt a very beginner friendly language, but I'm managing ok so far.<br>
    <br>what really drew me into Rust, compared to other languages like C or C++, is that Rust is memory safe by default. Where as in C and other languages you need to manually manage memory which can lead to memory leaks etc.</p>
</div>
<br>
<div class="round3">
    <p>One of the ways that rust makes it so "easy" to write safe code, is that variables are immutable (unchangeable) by default and also there is ownership and borrowing rules for accessing them outside of their scope (functions)<br>
    <br>this has been a lot to wrap my head around tbh. Also the differences of expressions and statments confused me for a bit, but once you get the hang of it it's pretty rewarding.</p>

    <p>anyways heres some dumb stuff I made so far.</p><br><br>

    <p>this ones a bit mor euseful lol</p>
</div>

<div class="round3">
    <p>Also cool with rust is you can compile the code and all its dependencies into an executable, kind of like pyinstaller on python but a lot cleaner and smaller and faster since python is an interpreted language, it needs the python interpreter included in the .exe.<br>
        But anyways I sent it to my phone to see if it would run in the termux tty emulator but it doesn't because the phone uses a different type of processor. Might be able to get it going with more research but It was just a quick experiment for now
