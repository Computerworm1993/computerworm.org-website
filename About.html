I guess you could say this is mostly just an art project of mine, or I guess a blog?, but mostly it's a way for me to learn more about programming, which I have taken a keen
interest in. I'll mostly just be posting my projects related to programming/micro-controllers/SBCs etc. and maybe some art idk, whatever I feel like I guess. I'll be experimenting with all sorts of code and techniques here and generally just messing around having fun making something mine.</p>

<p><span>I know there are a lot of modern "frameworks" and tools for building websites these days but I'm not
too interested in that. I wanted to try making one from the ground up
like in the good old days when the internet felt like the wild west. I do miss how unique websites used to feel. 
When anybody and everybody would make their own random pointless websites just for the hell of it. Like www.catlovers.com or www.jfkassasinationtruth.org</p>

<p><span>From a design perspective it was absolute hell, gifs crammed into every nook and cranny, font colours completely contrasting with backgrounds making
text almost unreadable. But thats part of the charm of it that I love and feel nostalgic for.</p>

<p><span>Anyways I wrote this site using HTML, CSS, and a little bit of javascript in the windows notepad application. I also used my favourite digital art software Krita
which is basically a photoshop clone. Kritas awesome, it's also what I use to make gifs and animations. <img style="float: right; margin: 0px 15px 0px;" src="Art/about/worm.gif" width="50" />[I love onion layers]</p>


<p> <span>My original plan was to self host this on a $30 RPi 02w, but upon further research I found out that that was actually a terrible idea [in regards to network security]
and as it turns out you can host a static website on github for free. So that's what I've done here. My .org domain name costs $6/year. I tried to get computerworm.com but some dink owns it already and is
trying to sell it for $7000 US lmao. But thats ok, a .org domain is kind of funny and I think its even cooler actually. My own organization [';,,;']</p>
<p>

<p><span>Also I'd like to mention that pretty much any gif I didn't make myself I got from gifcities.org, which is a special project of the Internet Archive [non-profit digital library, dedicated to preserving the web].
Check it out, it's thousands of amazing Y2K era gold </p>
<p> <span>Anyways thanks for visiting, hope you enjoy, and maybe feel inspired to make your own website.</p>
