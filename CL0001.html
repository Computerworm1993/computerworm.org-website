<p><strong>Introduction:</strong></p>
<p>Looking into buying a second cheap laptop like a refurbished thinkpad or something to have a linux distro on. I'm tired of windows honestly.
I don't do any gaming on my pc anyways and the shit I actually want to do works best in linux. I tried using WSL-Windows subsytem for linux, and it seemed like it was working fine until
I tried to install some python libraries and discovered how terribly bugged it was. Trying to get the subsystem os to connect to my network was impossible. Well it was possible, but only after
manually editing a config file [youd have to do this every.single.time], but then when I'd try and open up VScode it would reset
the config file so im back at square one. I ended up giving up on WSL altogether and have been doing all my programming directly onto a RPi 02w. This has been fine for me up until now since thats whats going to be running the code when it's finished,
but I have other projects I'd like to make such as experimenting with Selenium webdriver to control chromium. I'd like to try making an instagram bot that can run scripts depending on what
people dm me. For example, if someone messaged me "!Adzuki", it would take a picture of my vivarium, record current humidity/temp, and reply to that persons message with the data and picture. How cool would that be!!</p>
<p>Also I love working in a terminal I think it's so fun. And all the linux customizations are wicked cool too. I'd probably start with a Ubuntu distro since its similar to what I'm learning working on RPis, but eventually I'd like to get Arch linux figured out.
I find it funny how in the linux communities users will call their customizations "rice" or "riced up", just like the japanese imported car market crowd will call cars with a bunch of modifications riced out. Things that dont necessarily help you performance wise but damn they look sharp</p>
